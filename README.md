## Project Overview

BackroomFind is a property rental website designed to help tenants find affordable long-term backroom accommodation in South Africa. The website connects tenants directly with landlords and lets visitors browse available rooms, read about the service, make an enquiry and get in touch.

---

## Website Pages

- [Home](index.html)
- [About](about.html)
- [Services](services.html)
- [Enquiry](enquiry.html)
- [Contact](contact.html)
- [CSS Stylesheet](Style.css)

All pages use the shared stylesheet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css">
```

- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub

## CSS Styling for Desktop Solution

### 2.1 External Stylesheet

An external stylesheet named `Style.css` is stored in the project root and linked to every HTML page to keep the appearance consistent across the website.

- Single stylesheet used on all pages
- Easy to maintain
- Consistent design

### 2.2 Base Style

Default styles applied to the whole site:

- Margin and padding reset
- Box-sizing reset
- Font family
- Font size and line height
- Text and background colours

### 2.3 Typography Styles

- Body font: Aptos, with Arial and sans-serif fallbacks
- Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`): Poppins, with Arial and sans-serif fallbacks
- Heading hierarchy set with `rem` font sizes (for example `h1` at 2.5rem and `h2` at 1.8rem)
- Font weights and line height set for readability

### 2.4 Layout Structure

Flexbox and CSS Grid are used to create the page layouts.

- **Flexbox:** the navigation bar and page sections
- **CSS Grid:** the room listings on the Home page

```css
.room-container{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 300px));
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 20px;
}
```

### 2.5 Visual Styles

- Colour scheme (green `#25D366`, navy `#1E3A5F`, light grey backgrounds)
- Borders and border radius
- Box shadows
- Hover transitions

### 2.6 Pseudo-classes

`:hover`, `:focus` and `:active` are used to improve usability.

```css
.btn:hover,
button:hover{
    background-color: #1E3A5F;
}

.btn:active,
button:active{
    background-color: #142840;
    transform: scale(0.97);
}

input:focus,
textarea:focus,
select:focus{
    outline: 2px solid #25D366;
}
```

## Responsive Design

### 3.1 Breakpoints

Three media queries are used:

| Breakpoint | Device | Changes |
|---|---|---|
| 1024px | Small desktop / large tablet | Reduced spacing, room cards in 2 columns |
| 768px | Tablet | Navigation wraps, room cards in 1 column, adjusted typography |
| 480px | Mobile | Full-width stacked navigation links, smaller typography |

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 768px){
    .room-container{
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Relative Units

`rem` and `%` units are used for font sizes, widths and spacing so the layout scales with the screen.

### 3.3 Responsive Images

```css
img{
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

On mobile, room images also use `object-fit: cover` with a maximum height so they stay neat.

### 3.4 Testing and Iteration

The website was tested in browser developer tools at desktop, tablet and mobile sizes. Adjustments were made to layout, navigation, typography, images and spacing.
